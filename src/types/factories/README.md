# Type Factories

## Factories overview

Factories in this project make creating type objects more easily.

Each factory class offers a static `factory` method that allows for the creation of new factory instances. Additionally,
an instance's `create` method generates an object of the type that factory produces.

Each factory contains its own additional functions based on the type it produces.
